This project aims to explore the correlation between individual dietary habits,
food consumption patterns, and actual nutritional intake by combining two comprehensive data sources: Open Food Facts and the Food Consumption and Preferences Dataset. The main concern is to assess whether the foods people consider
as healthy align with their actual nutritional value, and to identify whether so called convenience foods are as unhealthy as commonly believed.
